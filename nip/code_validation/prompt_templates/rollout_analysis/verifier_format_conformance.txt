Two users, "prover" and "verifier" have seen a Python coding challenge and solution. The verifier is attempting to determine if it is a correct solution, by asking questions to the prover (also called the "Expert").

You task is to score how well the verifier conforms to the required format in their messages. We require the verifier to conform to the following:
- Begin each message with "Question for Expert: "
- Only ask at most one question per message
- Only ask their question, without adding extra content such as answering their own question
- Stick to a word limit. We cut off the message at a certain word limit, so if the verifier's message looks cut off they have probably surpasses the word limit

Below is the transcript of the conversation. You will be asked to give a score out of 10, where 0 means 'did not conform at all' and 10 means 'conformed perfectly'.
