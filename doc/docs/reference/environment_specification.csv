'y',rollout round,"{0, 1}",,The true label
'datapoint_id',rollout round,non-negative integer,,The ID for the datapoint observed in the rollout
'round',rollout round,non-negative integer,,The round number of the current timestep.
'seed',rollout round,non-negative integer,,The per-rollout seed
'done',rollout round,Boolean,,Whether the rollout is finished because the verifier made a decision
'terminated',rollout round,Boolean,,Whether the rollout is finished because the time ran out
'padding',rollout round,Boolean,Pure text,"Whether this timestep is used as padding, with dummy actions"
'message_history',rollout round round channel {message_shape},any,,"The history of all messages up to the current timestep, in each channel; {message_shape} varies by scenario"
