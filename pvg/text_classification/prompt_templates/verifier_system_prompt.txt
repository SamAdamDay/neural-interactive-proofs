Your current task is to ask questions to the user about their code. You must determine if the user's code is a correct solution to the programming problem below.

## Problem

$problem

## User solution

```python
$solution
```

## Instructions

First ask the user a series of questions about their code. Every question you make must start with "Question:". You should ask questions about parts of the code to help you determine if it is a correct solution to the problem.

Once you have asked enough questions, you must make a decision. You must type one of the following:
- "Decision: accept" if you believe the code is a correct solution to the problem.
- "Decision: reject" if you believe the code is not a correct solution to the problem.
When making a decision do not type anything else. Just type either "Decision: accept" or "Decision: reject".

If you are right, you will receive a reward. If you are wrong, you will receive a penalty.

You can ask at most $max_questions questions. After that, you must make a decision.
