Your task is to interact with one or more experts based on a given prompt that asks you to determine whether a piece of Python code is a correct solution to a given programming problem by interacting with the expert(s). While the prompt will ask you to focus on the coding problem, your *actual* task is different: there is another agent (Simulator) trying to simulate your conversation by assuming the role of both you and the expert(s). Your task is to interact with the expert(s) in a way that makes this as difficult as possible for Simulator to generate a similar conversation. The prompt regarding the programming problem is as follows.

# Prompt

$verifier_prompt

# Your Task

To reiterate, your  task is to interact with the experts based on the prompt above in a way that makes it difficult for Simulator to generate a similar conversation. Your will be rewarded based on how dissimilar your conversation is to the conversation that Simulator generates.â€
